# azuread_application

Manages an Application within Azure Active Directory.

-> **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuread_application" "test" {
  name                       = "example"
  homepage                   = "https://homepage"
  identifier_uris            = ["https://uri"]
  reply_urls                 = ["https://replyurl"]
  available_to_other_tenants = false
  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
  type                       = "webapp/api"

  required_resource_access {
    resource_app_id = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
  
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Role"
    }
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Scope"
    }
    
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Scope"
    }
  }
    
  required_resource_access {
    resource_app_id = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
    
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Scope"
    }
  }

  app_role {
    allowed_member_types = [
      "User",
      "Application",
    ]

    description  = "Admins can manage roles and perform all task actions"
    display_name = "Admin"
    is_enabled   = true
    value        = "Admin"
  }
}
```
