```hcl
resource "azuread_application" "test" {
  name                       = "example"
  homepage                   = "https://homepage"
  identifier_uris            = ["https://uri"]
  reply_urls                 = ["https://replyurl"]
  available_to_other_tenants = false
  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
  type                       = "webapp/api"

  required_resource_access {
    resource_app_id = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
  
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Role"
    }
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Scope"
    }
    
    resource_access {
      id = "..."
      type = "Scope"
    }
  }
    
  required_resource_access {
    resource_app_id = "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
    
    resource_access {
