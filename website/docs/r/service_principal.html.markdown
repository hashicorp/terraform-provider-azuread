# azuread_service_principal

Manages a Service Principal associated with an Application within Azure Active Directory.

-> **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API. Please see The [Granting a Service Principal permission to manage AAD](../auth/service_principal_configuration.html) for the required steps. 

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuread_application" "test" {
  name                       = "example"
  homepage                   = "http://homepage"
  identifier_uris            = ["http://uri"]
  reply_urls                 = ["http://replyurl"]
  available_to_other_tenants = false
  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
}

resource "azuread_service_principal" "test" {
  application_id = "${azuread_application.test.application_id}"
  
  tags = ["example", "tags", "here"]
}
```
