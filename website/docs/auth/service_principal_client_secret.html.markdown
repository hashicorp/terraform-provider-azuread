# Azure Active Directory Provider: Authenticating using a Service Principal with a Client Secret

Terraform supports a number of different methods for authenticating to Azure:

* [Authenticating to Azure using the Azure CLI](azure_cli.html)
* [Authenticating to Azure using Managed Service Identity](managed_service_identity.html)
* [Authenticating to Azure using a Service Principal and a Client Certificate](service_principal_client_certificate.html)
* Authenticating to Azure using a Service Principal and a Client Secret (which is covered in this guide)

Further steps must be taken to grant a Service Principal permission to manage objects in an Azure Active Directory:
 
[Granting a Service Principal permission to manage AAD](service_principal_configuration.html)

---

We recommend using either a Service Principal or Managed Service Identity when running Terraform non-interactively (such as when running Terraform in a CI server) - and authenticating using the Azure CLI when running Terraform locally.

Beyond authentication and managing Azure AAD resources further steps are required to make so a Service principal can make changes to Azure Active Directory objects such as users and groups. The [Granting a Service Principal permission to manage AAD](service_principal_configuration.html) guide contains the required steps.

## Creating a Service Principal

A Service Principal is an application within Azure Active Directory whose authentication tokens can be used as the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id` fields needed by Terraform (`subscription_id` can be independently recovered from your Azure account details).

It's possible to complete this task in either the [Azure CLI](#creating-a-service-principal-using-the-azure-cli) or in the [Azure Portal](#creating-a-service-principal-in-the-azure-portal) - in both we'll create a Service Principal which has `Contributor` rights to the subscription. [It's also possible to assign other rights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/role-based-access-built-in-roles/) depending on your configuration.

###Â Creating a Service Principal using the Azure CLI

~> **Note**: If you're using the **China**, **German** or **Government** Azure Clouds - you'll need to first configure the Azure CLI to work with that Cloud.  You can do this by running:

```shell
$ az cloud set --name AzureChinaCloud|AzureGermanCloud|AzureUSGovernment
```

---

Firstly, login to the Azure CLI using:

```shell
$ az login
```

Once logged in - it's possible to list the Subscriptions associated with the account via:

```shell
$ az account list
```

The output (similar to below) will display one or more Subscriptions - with the `id` field being the `subscription_id` field referenced above.

```json
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "PAYG Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "user": {
      "name": "user@example.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

Should you have more than one Subscription, you can specify the Subscription to use via the following command:

```shell
$ az account set --subscription="SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

We can now create the Service Principal which will have permissions to manage resources in the specified Subscription using the following command:

```shell
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

This command will output 5 values:

```json
{
  "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "password": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "tenant": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

These values map to the Terraform variables like so:

 - `appId` is the `client_id` defined above.
 - `password` is the `client_secret` defined above.
 - `tenant` is the `tenant_id` defined above.

---

Finally, it's possible to test these values work as expected by first logging in:

```shell
$ az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID
```

Once logged in as the Service Principal - we should be able to list the VM sizes by specifying an Azure region, for example here we use the `West US` region:

```shell
$ az vm list-sizes --location westus
```

~> **Note**: If you're using the **China**, **German** or **Government** Azure Clouds - you will need to switch `westus` out for another region. You can find which regions are available by running:

```shell
$ az account list-locations
```

Finally, since we're logged into the Azure CLI as a Service Principal we recommend logging out of the Azure CLI (but you can instead log in using your user account):

```bash
$ az logout
```

Information on how to configure the Provider block using the newly created Service Principal credentials can be found below.

### Creating a Service Principal in the Azure Portal

There are three tasks necessary to create a Service Principal using [the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):

 1. Create an Application in Azure Active Directory (which acts as a Service Principal)
 2. Generating a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application (which can be used for authentication)
 3. Grant the Application access to manage resources in your Azure Subscription

### 1. Creating an Application in Azure Active Directory

Firstly navigate to [the **Azure Active Directory** overview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) within the Azure Portal - [then select the **App Registration** blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview) and click **Endpoints** at the top of the **App Registration** blade. A list of URIs will be displayed and you need to locate the URI for **OAUTH 2.0 AUTHORIZATION ENDPOINT** which contains a GUID. This GUID is your Tenant ID (the `tenant_id` field mentioned above).

Next, navigate back to [the **App Registration** blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview) - from here we'll create the Application in Azure Active Directory. To do this click **New application registration** at the top to add a new Application within Azure Active Directory. On this page, set the following values then press **Create**:

- **Name** - this is a friendly identifier and can be anything (e.g. "Terraform")
- **Application Type** - this should be set to "Web app / API"
- **Sign-on URL** - this can be anything, providing it's a valid URI (e.g. https://terra.form)

At this point the newly created Azure Active Directory application should be visible on-screen - if it's not, navigate to the [the **App Registration** blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview) and select the Azure Active Directory application. At the top of this page, the "Application ID" GUID is the `client_id` you'll need.

### 2. Generating a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application

Now that the Azure Active Directory Application exists we can create a Client Secret which can be used for authentication - to do this select **Settings** and then **Keys**. This screen displays the Passwords (Client Secrets) and Public Keys (Client Certificates) which are associated with this Azure Active Directory Application.

On this screen we can generate a new Password by entering a Description and selecting an Expiry Date, and then pressing **Save**. Once the Password has been generated it will be displayed on screen - _the Password is only displayed once_ so **be sure to copy it now** (otherwise you will need to regenerate a new key). This newly generated Password is the `client_secret` you will need.

### 3. Granting the Application access to manage resources in your Azure Subscription

Once the Application exists in Azure Active Directory - we can grant it permissions to modify resources in the Subscription. To do this, [navigate to the **Subscriptions** blade within the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade), then select the Subscription you wish to use, then click **Access Control (IAM)**, and finally **Add role assignment**.

Firstly, specify a Role which grants the appropriate permissions needed for the Service Principal (for example, `Contributor` will grant Read/Write on all resources in the Subscription). There's more information about [the built in roles available here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/role-based-access-built-in-roles/).

Secondly, search for and select the name of the Application created in Azure Active Directory to assign it this role - then press **Save**.

### Configuring the Service Principal in Terraform

As we've obtained the credentials for this Service Principal - it's possible to configure them in a few different ways.

When storing the credentials as Environment Variables, for example:

```bash
$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

The following Provider block can be specified - where `1.20.0` is the version of the Azure Provider that you'd like to use:

```hcl
provider "azuread" {
  # Whilst version is optional, we /strongly recommend/ using it to pin the version of the Provider being used
  version = "=0.1.0"
}
```

More information on [the fields supported in the Provider block can be found here](../index.html#argument-reference).

At this point running either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` should allow Terraform to run using the Service Principal to authenticate.

---

It's also possible to configure these variables either in-line or from using variables in Terraform (as the `client_secret` is in this example), like so:

~> **NOTE:** We'd recommend not defining these variables in-line since they could easily be checked into Source Control.

```hcl
variable "client_secret" {}

provider "azuread" {
  # Whilst version is optional, we /strongly recommend/ using it to pin the version of the Provider being used
  version = "=0.1.0"

  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_secret   = "${var.client_secret}"
  tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

More information on [the fields supported in the Provider block can be found here](../index.html#argument-reference).

At this point running either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` should allow Terraform to run using the Service Principal to authenticate.

Next you may want to follow the [Granting a Service Principal permission to manage AAD](service_principal_configuration.html) guide to grant the Service Ability permission to create and modify Azure Active Directory objects such as users and groups.
