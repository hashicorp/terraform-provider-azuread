# Resource: azuread_service_principal_certificate

Manages a certificate associated with a service principal within Azure Active Directory.

## API Permissions

The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Application.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Application Administrator` or `Global Administrator`

## Example Usage

*Using a PEM certificate*

```terraform
resource "azuread_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
}

resource "azuread_service_principal" "example" {
  application_id = azuread_application.example.application_id
}

resource "azuread_service_principal_certificate" "example" {
  service_principal_id = azuread_service_principal.example.id
  type                 = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
  value                = file("cert.pem")
  end_date             = "2021-05-01T01:02:03Z"
}
```

*Using a DER certificate*

```terraform
resource "azuread_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
}

resource "azuread_service_principal" "example" {
  application_id = azuread_application.example.application_id
}

resource "azuread_service_principal_certificate" "example" {
  service_principal_id = azuread_service_principal.example.id
  type                 = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
  encoding             = "base64"
  value                = base64encode(file("cert.der"))
  end_date             = "2021-05-01T01:02:03Z"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `encoding` - (Optional) Specifies the encoding used for the supplied certificate data. Must be one of `pem`, `base64` or `hex`. Defaults to `pem`.

-> **Tip for Azure Key Vault** The `hex` encoding option is useful for consuming certificate data from the [azurerm_key_vault_certificate](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/key_vault_certificate) resource.

* `end_date` - (Optional) The end date until which the certificate is valid, formatted as an RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
* `end_date_relative` - (Optional) A relative duration for which the certificate is valid until, for example `240h` (10 days) or `2400h30m`. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.

~> One of `end_date` or `end_date_relative` must be set. The maximum duration is determined by Azure AD.

* `key_id` - (Optional) A UUID used to uniquely identify this certificate. If not specified a UUID will be automatically generated. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
* `service_principal_id` - (Required) The object ID of the service principal for which this certificate should be created. Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
* `start_date` - (Optional) The start date from which the certificate is valid, formatted as an RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`). If this isn't specified, the current date is used.  Changing this field forces a new resource to be created.
* `type` - (Required) The type of key/certificate. Must be one of `AsymmetricX509Cert` or `Symmetric`. Changing this fields forces a new resource to be created.
* `value` - (Required) The certificate data, which can be PEM encoded, base64 encoded DER or hexadecimal encoded DER. See also the `encoding` argument.

## Attributes Reference

No additional attributes are exported.

## Import

Certificates can be imported using the object ID of the associated service principal and the key ID of the certificate credential, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azuread_service_principal_certificate.test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/certificate/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

-> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the service principal's object ID, the string "certificate" and the certificate's key ID in the format `{ServicePrincipalObjectId}/certificate/{CertificateKeyId}`.
