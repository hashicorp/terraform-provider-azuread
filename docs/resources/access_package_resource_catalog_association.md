  resource_origin_system = "AadGroup"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `catalog_id` - (Required) The unique ID of the access package catalog. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `resource_origin_id` - (Required) The unique identifier of the resource in the origin system. In the case of an Azure AD group, this is the identifier of the group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `resource_origin_system` - (Required) The type of the resource in the origin system, such as `SharePointOnline`, `AadApplication` or `AadGroup`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of this resource, the ID is the concatenation of `catalog_id` and `resource_origin_id` with colon in between.

## Import

The resource and catalog association can be imported using the catalog ID and the resource origin ID, e.g.

```
terraform import azuread_access_package_resource_catalog_association.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

-> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the Catalog ID and the Resource Origin ID in the format `{CatalogID}/{ResourceOriginID}`.
