# Resource: azuread_conditional_access_policy

Manages a Conditional Access Policy within Azure Active Directory.

-> **Licensing Requirements** Specifying `client_applications` property requires the activation of Microsoft Entra on your tenant and the availability of sufficient Workload Identities Premium licences (one per service principal managed by a conditional access).

## API Permissions

The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires the following application roles: `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` and `Policy.Read.All`

When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Conditional Access Administrator` or `Global Administrator`

## Example Usage

### All users except guests or external users

```terraform
resource "azuread_conditional_access_policy" "example" {
  display_name = "example policy"

  conditions {
    client_app_types    = ["all"]
    sign_in_risk_levels = ["medium"]
    user_risk_levels    = ["medium"]

    applications {
      included_applications = ["All"]
      excluded_applications = []
    }
