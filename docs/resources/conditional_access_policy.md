# Resource: azuread_conditional_access_policy

Manages a Conditional Access Policy within Azure Active Directory.

-> **Licensing Requirements** Specifying `client_applications` property requires the activation of Microsoft Entra on your tenant and the availability of sufficient Workload Identities Premium licences (one per service principal managed by a conditional access).

-> **API Limits** This resource is subject to a restrictive API request limit of 1 request/second. Whilst Terraform will automatically back-off and retry throttled requests, if you have a large number of resource changes to make, you may wish to [reduce parallelism](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#apply-options) or specify extended [custom resource timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts).

## API Permissions

The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires the following application roles: `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` and `Policy.Read.All`

When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Conditional Access Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
