# Resource: azuread_named_location

-> **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to `Policy.Read.All` and `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "azuread_named_location" "example-ip" {
  display_name = "IP Named Location"
  ip {
    ip_ranges = [
      "1.1.1.1/32",
      "2.2.2.2/32",
    ]
    trusted = true
  }
}

resource "azuread_named_location" "example-country" {
  display_name = "Country Named Location"
  country {
    countries_and_regions = [
      "GB",
      "US",
    ]
    include_unknown_countries_and_regions = false
  }
}
```
