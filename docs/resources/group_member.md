## Import

Group members can be imported using the object ID of the group and the object ID of the member, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azuread_group_member.test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

-> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the Azure AD Group Object ID and the target Member Object ID in the format `{GroupObjectID}/member/{MemberObjectID}`.
