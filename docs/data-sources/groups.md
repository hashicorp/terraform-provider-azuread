}
```

}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_names` - (Optional) The display names of the groups.
* `mail_enabled` - (Optional) Whether the returned groups should be mail-enabled. By itself this does not exclude security-enabled groups. Setting this to `true` ensures all groups are mail-enabled, and setting to `false` ensures that all groups are _not_ mail-enabled. To ignore this filter, omit the property or set it to null. Cannot be specified together with `object_ids`.
* `object_ids` - (Optional) The object IDs of the groups.
* `return_all` - (Optional) A flag to denote if all groups should be fetched and returned.
* `security_enabled` - (Optional) Whether the returned groups should be security-enabled. By itself this does not exclude mail-enabled groups. Setting this to `true` ensures all groups are security-enabled, and setting to `false` ensures that all groups are _not_ security-enabled. To ignore this filter, omit the property or set it to null. Cannot be specified together with `object_ids`.

~> One of `display_names`, `object_ids` or `return_all` should be specified. Either of the first two _may_ be specified as an empty list, in which case no results will be returned.

## Attributes Reference
