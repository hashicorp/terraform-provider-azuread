# Data Source: azuread_service_principal

Gets information about an existing service principal associated with an application within Azure Active Directory.

## API Permissions

The following API permissions are required in order to use this data source.

When authenticated with a service principal, this data source requires one of the following application roles: `Application.Read.All` or `Directory.Read.All`

When authenticated with a user principal, this data source does not require any additional roles.

## Example Usage

*Look up by application display name*

```terraform
data "azuread_service_principal" "example" {
  display_name = "my-awesome-application"
}
```

*Look up by client ID*

```terraform
data "azuread_service_principal" "example" {
  client_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

*Look up by service principal object ID*

```terraform
data "azuread_service_principal" "example" {
  object_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `client_id` - (Optional) The client ID of the application associated with this service principal.
* `display_name` - (Optional) The display name of the application associated with this service principal.
* `object_id` - (Optional) The object ID of the service principal.

~> One of `client_id`, `display_name` or `object_id` must be specified.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `account_enabled` - Whether the service principal account is enabled.
* `alternative_names` - A list of alternative names, used to retrieve service principals by subscription, identify resource group and full resource ids for managed identities.
* `app_role_assignment_required` - Whether this service principal requires an app role assignment to a user or group before Azure AD will issue a user or access token to the application.
* `app_role_ids` - A mapping of app role values to app role IDs, as published by the associated application, intended to be useful when referencing app roles in other resources in your configuration.
* `app_roles` - A list of app roles published by the associated application, as documented below. For more information [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/app-roles).

* `notes` - A free text field to capture information about the service principal, typically used for operational purposes.
* `notification_email_addresses` - A list of email addresses where Azure AD sends a notification when the active certificate is near the expiration date. This is only for the certificates used to sign the SAML token issued for Azure AD Gallery applications.
* `object_id` - The object ID of the service principal.
